> *'Listen to the Weather'*

## Object
***Instead of just looking at the weather, listen to it! The user can search for a location or click it on the map to find out what the weather will be like!***

***The music is generated in real time and is based on a selection of weather parameters: "Temperature", "humidity", "cloud cover", "rain", "snow", "wind" etc. The sound must be linked to the different weather conditions, in order to create a sensation that evokes the atmospherical events. The user should listen to the sound and immediately understand whatâ€™s the weather like.***
