# soniWeather_Map
> *'Listen to the Weather'*

## Object
***Our goal is to give the users a map that can generate sounds that are related to the location of the city and the corresponding weather of the city. At the same time, users can also get the weather forecas information of the corresponding city, like "Temperature", "Humidity", "Wind Speed", "Cloud Cover", "Rain Probability", etc.***

## Structure
***The project can be divided into three parts:***
- MAP

<br/>


- SOUND DESIGN<br/>
***e.g. The following is the structure of the synthesized cloud cover sound. We have to consider many parameter of weather like the humidity, temperature, etc.***
